# Datacamp

The main coding language in this minor is python. To get familiar with this coding language i began a online coding tutorial named Datacamp. In Datacamp you have a multiple courses with different goals. The main subject are: handling with pandas dataframes, preparing data, applying models and validating models. 

After finishing 100% of the assigned datacamp courses, i have learned a lot about machine learning and python. Through Datacamp i improve my knowledge about how to use python with lage datasets and improve these datasets for machine learning. Futhermore datacamp tought me what machine learning is and how you can implement different models like KNearestNeighbor, Linear Regression and DecisionTree with python. 
My process of Datacamp can be seen through this link: [Datacamp progress](Assignments-DataCampLearn.pdf)
