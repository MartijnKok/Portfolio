# Portfolio
Individual portfolio of the contribution to the project, my abilities and what i have learned

## Introduction
My name is Martijn Kok and i am a fourth year electrical engineering student that has done Applied Data Science as a minor. During de Applied Data Science minor i learned a lot about data and what can be achieved with just data. Through out the whole minor i have improved my abilities like Project Communication and Data Visualization, but i also learned a lot of new abilities like Predictive Models, Data preparation and Evaluation. This portfolio will be proof of what i have learned during this minor


## Datacamp online course
The main coding language in this minor is python. To get familiar with this coding language i began a online coding tutorial named Datacamp. In Datacamp you have a multiple courses with different goals. The main subject are: handling with pandas dataframes, preparing data, applying models and validating models. 

After finishing 100% of the assigned datacamp courses, i have learned a lot about machine learning and python. Through Datacamp i improve my knowledge about how to use python with lage datasets and improve these datasets for machine learning. Futhermore datacamp tought me what machine learning is and how you can implement different models like KNearestNeighbor, Linear Regression and DecisionTree with python. 
My process of Datacamp can be seen through this link: [Datacamp progress](Datacamp/Assignments-DataCampLearn.pdf)
