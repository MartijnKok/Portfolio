# Portfolio
Individual portfolio of the contribution to the project, my abilities and what i have learned

## Introduction
My name is Martijn Kok and i am a fourth year electrical engineering student that has done Applied Data Science as a minor. During de Applied Data Science minor i learned a lot about data and what can be achieved with just data. Through out the whole minor i have improved my abilities like Project Communication and Data Visualization, but i also learned a lot of new abilities like Predictive Models, Data preparation and Evaluation. This portfolio will be proof of what i have learned during this minor

### Datacamp online course
During the first block of the minor i improved my python coding skill with a online coding course named Datacamp. More informations about Datacamp and my improved skill see this link: [Datacamp](Datacamp/)

### Data Visualization
In the minor i learned about the importance of Data Visualization. During the project in the minor data visualization was a big part. More informations how i used data visualization can be seen through this link: [Data Visualization](Data_Visualization/)
