# Data Preparation

## Use mathematical functions to help a model
Differential equations, Low pass filters, Dividing, Multiplying (USE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK DETECTING SPRINTS AND TIMESTAMP)

## Split/Balancing Data
Balancing data for the project because of low positive datapoints. Split realtime data into slices of 1 second
