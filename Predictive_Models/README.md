# Predictive Models

 ## Kaggle Competition
 Learned more about multivariable linear regression, polynomials and ridge models. [Kaggle Housing Competition](2.2_Kaggle_Housing_Competition.pdf)
 
 ## Machine Learning Detection sprints
 Started to work with data of the project. Learned more about GridSearchCV and models like Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and  SVM models.

## Neural Network
Learned about how a Neural Network thinks and how to implement it on a sensordata

## Convolutional Neural Network
Learned about the use of convolutional layers in a Neural Network. 

## Recurrent Neural Network
To improve a Neural Network a recurrent neural network was used by me. This Network will learn from each layer during the predicting fase.
