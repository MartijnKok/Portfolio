# Data Visualization
During the minor i have done a lot of Data visualization to understand the dataset of my project (Wheels). In this section i will explain what i have done with Data Visualization and what i have learned.

## Detecting patterns in Data
I was part of the wheels project group in the minor. Before we could start with coding we needed to understand the data. Therefore i have written a visualization code that will visualize all the action different wheelchair basketball players have done, see &(#*@)@*@). This visualization code helped me understand the importance of visualization/understanding your data before you can train a model. Through the visualization the best features for the model can be choosen. 

## Balancing Data 
When i started with fitting the dataset of the wheels project group to a model i ran into a problem. The model didn't have great results because the dataset wasn't balanced. The balance of the dataset was balanced to see how bad it was see: XXXXdDJljdf. The dataset was more inbalanced then i thought, with this information i balanced the dataset.

## Checking False Negatives
In the wheels project there weren't any good ground truths in the dataset. This was a problem when i wanted to check the precision of a model, because i didn't know if a false negative was really a false negative. To check if a false negative wasn't a positive, all false negatives of a model where visualized with the following code: JSFLF*U)(A)(.
